# Task-manager

Develop an application built around MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js (MEAN). 

For my application, I built a task manager application that allows the user to enter a task name, date, priority of the task and a note.

Allows the user with the following features:

      - Edit Post: you can edit the task name, date, priority, and note.
      - Delete Post: deletes a selected task.
      - Mark a task complete/incomplete : sets a task to is complete/incomplete and it will then display in Completed/incomplete tasks page.
      - View/edit task note: task note can be viewed from a pop out dialog and can also be edited and updated. 
      - Update priority

After cloning run `npm install @angular/cli` then run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

Run server in the `backend/` `node or nodemon server.js`
